      * [r1] Initial release: brining  a simple genetic algorithm for complex problems.


## TO DO
+ Add the mutation and crossover rate to the parameters of the function (mutRateGenome and ??).
+ Not only allow the posibility of mutation in the genome, but also in the addtive effects (mutRateTrait)
+ Is there any benefit in allowing ploidy?
+ add the metrics: rate of coancestry (from formula) and rate of inbreeding (from the diagonal of the GRM of selected inds and all inds) to the output
+ improve the regression approach
+ in pareto plot should we scale the y-axis over the number of solutions provided
