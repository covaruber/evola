      * [r2] Improve to have a single fitness function across traits. More efficient matrix operations. Additional examples for how to do regression and add contraints.

      * [r3] Added additional arguments for stopping criteria and to keepBest to trace the path to the best solution.
      


## TO DO
+ Add recombination rate through the use of the number of chromosomes and chromosome size
+ Add the mutation rate by using the function editGenomeTopQtl().
+ Not only allow the posibility of mutation in the genome, but also in the addtive effects (mutRateTrait)
+ Make a function that traces the pedigree of the best solution easily? maybe just let the user download a package that builds pedigree plots and that way they can recreate the crossing path. 
+ Is there any benefit in allowing ploidy and heterozigosity? (e.g. more possible solutions)
