      * [r1] Initial release: brining  a simple genetic algorithm for complex problems.


## TO DO
+ Add the mutation and crossover rate to the parameters of the function (mutRateGenome and ??).
+ Not only allow the posibility of mutation in the genome, but also in the addtive effects (mutRateTrait)
+ Is there any benefit in allowing ploidy? (e.g. more possible solutions)
+ improve the regression approach
