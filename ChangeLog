      * [r1] Initial release: brining  a simple genetic algorithm for complex problems.

      * [r2] Improve to have a single fitness function across traits. More efficient matrix operations. Additional examples for how to do regression and add contraints.

      * [r2] Added additional arguments for stopping criteria and to keepBest to trace the path to the best solution.
      * [r2] Added mutRate and nChr arguments to control the mutation rate and recombination rate.

      * [r3] Now the traits with zero variance also work without errors
      * [r3] We print in the console the generation, number of removed solutions/individuals based on constraints, total number of individuals left and genetic variance
      * [r3] Now we allow to set different number of chromosomes which allows for a greater recombination rate by avoiding the LD and interference of having too many QTLs in the same chromosome

      * [r4] We set the OMP_THREAD_LIMITS to 2 with the .onLoad function to avoid CRAN checks to reject for using more than 2 cores during the vignette building step

      * [r5] Now the returning object from the evolafit function is an extended class of the 'Pop-class' object from AlphaSimR, an S4 object.
      * [r5] We changed the name of the argument to make the use of fitness functions more straightforward.
      * [r5] We added the fixQTLperInd argument to allow users to fix the number of activated QTLs for regression optimization problems
      * [r5] A fitness function named regFun has been added for regression problems.
      * [r5] A fitness function named inbFun has been added for problems where only the group relationship will be used as selection criteria.


## TO DO
+ Rename score by fitness in the score table
+ Double check that mutation goes both directions, maybe an additional argument.
+ Not only allow the posibility of mutation in the genome, but also in the addtive effects (mutRateTrait)
