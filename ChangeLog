      * [r2] Improve to have a single fitness function across traits. More efficient matrix operations. Additional examples for how to do regression and add contraints.

      * [r3] Added additional arguments for stopping criteria and to keepBest to trace the path to the best solution.
      


## TO DO
+ Add to vignettes that inbreeding of the selected crosses can be used as surrogate to decide the size of the population (segregants)
+ Add the mutation and crossover rate to the parameters of the function (mutRateGenome and ??).
+ Not only allow the posibility of mutation in the genome, but also in the addtive effects (mutRateTrait)
+ Make a function that traces the pedigree of the best solution easily
+ Is there any benefit in allowing ploidy and heterozigosity? (e.g. more possible solutions)
